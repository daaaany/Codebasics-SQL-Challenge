# Codebasics SQL Challenge

A project but before that want to thank codebasics for this challenge.

I've written these SQL queries in the RDBMS MySQL.
I tried to write each SQL query very neatly and effectively so that everyone can understand it easily.

During this project, first I used MySQL to do EDA and used Microsoft Excel to make visualization.

In this whole project, tech stack I used:
* MySQL
* Microsoft Excel
